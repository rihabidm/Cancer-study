Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and pharynx represents a major health challenge, requiring effective diagnostic and treatment strategies. In this context, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offers promising prospects for improving patient care. This project aims to leverage available clinical and genomic data to predict outcomes for patients with this type of cancer, ultimately aiming to enhance clinical outcomes and patients' quality of life.
